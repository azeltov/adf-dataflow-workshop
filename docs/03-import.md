### 3.4. Lets do a validation to ensure things look good

- Its important that you call your ADLS Gen 2 connection the same as what the instructor did for validation to be successful.<br>
- No fear if you named it differently, just extra work.<br>
- Go to every single dataset and reflect the correct linked service. (Fun :))<br>

You can now proceed to the next module.
